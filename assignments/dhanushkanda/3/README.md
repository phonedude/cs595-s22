## Extra credit: It's turtles all the way down...

* An interesting xkcd comic I found online: https://xkcd.com/1416/

* Turtles all the way down is a concept of the problem of infinite regress. For instance letâ€™s say the whole earth rests on the back of a turtle. This turtle rests on the back of an even larger turtle. Then this is supported by another larger turtle below it and it is an indefinite collection of turtles.

* In respect to web security, this referes to the scenario where we come across an embedding chain. For example target.com embeds attacker.com which embeds target.com.
